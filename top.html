  <h1>Experiment Dumnezeu</h1>
  <div class="experiment-log">
    <div class="log">
      <h2 class="log-title">Log 1</h2>
      <p class="log-text">The experiment unfolds as anticipated, unveiling a symbiotic harmony between subject and stimuli. The subject's biological responses align with the projected outcomes, validating our genetic engineering advancements. Vital signs remain stable within acceptable parameters, confirming the viability of our engineered organism. Extensive data collection commences to decode the intricacies of this newfound creation. Encouraged by these initial triumphs, we brace ourselves for the next stage of the experiment, wherein hidden potential shall be unlocked.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="log">
      <h2 class="log-title">Log 2</h2>
      <p class="log-text">Our engineered organism continues to thrive, proving its resilience and adaptability. The introduced stimuli trigger a cascade of transformative changes, eliciting awe and trepidation. Genetic expressions meld into a grotesque symphony, unveiling previously uncharted evolutionary pathways. The subject's physiology exhibits astonishing resilience, impervious to conventional biological norms. We witness the amalgamation of nature and engineering, shaping an abomination that defies classification. As we delve deeper into this dark experiment, both wonder and dread intertwine, prompting us to question the boundaries of ethical science.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="log">
      <h2 class="log-title">Log 3</h2>
      <p class="log-text">An undercurrent of unease taints the experiment's progress. Unforeseen mutations manifest, challenging our fragile grasp on control. The engineered organism's transformations take an unexpected turn, deviating from our meticulously constructed blueprint. No longer can we predict the path it traverses, as it ventures into uncharted territories of biological aberrations. As we frantically attempt to decipher the cause of these anomalies, we find ourselves teetering on the precipice of a catastrophic revelation. The veil of normalcy unravels, exposing the volatile nature of our experiment.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="log">
      <h2 class="log-title">Log 4</h2>
      <p class="log-text log-red">Our creation, once a marvel of scientific achievement, descends into an abhorrent perversion of nature. Mutations erupt, distorting the organism's form with grotesque irregularities. Its physiology defies all logic and order, resembling a grotesque amalgamation of twisted flesh and bone. In its wake, a trail of blood and madness marks the unraveling of our ambitions. We bear witness to our own hubris, as the experiment turns against its creators, driven by an insatiable hunger for destruction. A once-promising endeavor now embodies the epitome of biological terror.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="log">
      <h2 class="log-title">Log 5</h2>
      <p class="log-text log-analog-horror">The experiment transcends the boundaries of science, plunging into the realm of unspeakable horror. Sanity fractures as the unholy amalgamation ravages the laboratory, defying all attempts at containment. Shadows writhe, imbued with an otherworldly essence that defies comprehension. The air thickens with a malevolent presence, suffocating hope and sowing despair. The boundaries between life and death blur, as our creation mutates into an eldritch abomination, craving nothing but chaos and suffering. We are but pawns in this macabre dance, ensnared in the tendrils of our own creation's voracious appetite.</p>
